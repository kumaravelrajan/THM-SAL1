# System Configuration utility

The System Configuration utility (MSConfig) is for advanced troubleshooting, and its main purpose is to help diagnose startup issues. You need local administrator rights to open this utility.

- The Services tab lists all services configured for the system regardless of their state (running or stopped). **A service is a special type of application that runs in the background.**

Microsoft advises using Task Manager (taskmgr) to manage (enable/disable) startup items. The System Configuration utility is **NOT** a startup management program.#

There is a list of various utilities (tools) in the Tools tab that we can run to configure the operating system further. There is a brief description of each tool to provide some insight into what the tool is for.

Notice the **Selected command** section. The information in this textbox will change per tool.

To run a tool, we can use the command to launch the tool via the run prompt, command prompt, or by clicking the `Launch` button.
